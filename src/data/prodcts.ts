    title:'DeWalt DCD999 18v XR Cordless High Power Combi Hammer Drill',
    price: 399.00,
    currency: '£',
    category:'Drill',
    description: `
    The DCD999 is a powerful cordless combi drill which is part of the DeWalt Flexvolt Advantage range. This means that, as with other 18v XR tools, it is compatible with both 18v XR and Flexvolt batteries - however, unlike standard 18v tools, it is able to utilize the extra power in a Flexvolt battery to deliver increased performance as well as longer runtimes. When used with the Flexvolt DCB547 9ah battery, the power is increased by 51% in comparison with an 18v DCB184 5ah battery, a performance boost which is ideal for tougher applications like drilling large holes or driving large fasteners.

    Capable of delivering up to 126 Nm of torque, the DCD999 is supplied with a side handle and features an electronic clutch with 11 settings. It has a high quality, all-metal keyless chuck, brushless motor and integrated LED worklight with a delay feature which keeps the work area illuminated after the trigger is released.
